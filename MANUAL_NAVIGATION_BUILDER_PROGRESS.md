# Manual Navigation Tree Builder - Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of the manual navigation tree builder feature.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality

### Backend Development

#### Controllers & Routes
- [ ] Create `BuildController` or add `buildAction` to existing controller
- [ ] Add route `/admin/navigations/{id}/build` for main build page
- [ ] Create API endpoints for AJAX operations:
  - [ ] `GET /admin/navigations/{id}/build/items` - Load tree structure
  - [ ] `POST /admin/navigations/{id}/build/items` - Add new item
  - [ ] `PUT /admin/navigations/{id}/build/items/{itemId}` - Update item
  - [ ] `DELETE /admin/navigations/{id}/build/items/{itemId}` - Remove item
  - [ ] `POST /admin/navigations/{id}/build/items/reorder` - Reorder items

#### Existing Infrastructure (✅ Completed)
- [x] Item resource configured in `src/Resources/config/routes/admin.yaml`
- [x] Item grid configuration added to `SetonoSyliusNavigationExtension.php`
- [x] Translation keys added for item management UI
- [x] Routes generated at `/admin/navigation/items/*` for standard CRUD operations

#### Services & Logic
- [ ] Create tree serialization service for JSON API responses
- [ ] Implement item creation logic for AJAX requests
- [ ] Implement item update logic with validation
- [ ] Implement item deletion with cascade handling
- [ ] Implement reordering logic using ClosureManager
- [ ] Add proper error handling and validation

#### Templates
- [ ] Create main build page template
- [ ] Create item modal templates for editing
- [ ] Create partial templates for tree rendering

### Frontend Development

#### JavaScript Components
- [ ] Create tree display component
- [ ] Implement drag & drop functionality
- [ ] Create modal system for item editing
- [ ] Implement AJAX communication layer
- [ ] Add loading states and user feedback
- [ ] Implement error handling and display

#### UI Integration
- [ ] Add "Build manually" button to navigation edit page
- [ ] Style tree interface to match Sylius admin theme
- [ ] Create responsive design for tree management
- [ ] Add icons and visual indicators for different item types

### Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for new controllers
- [ ] Write unit tests for tree serialization
- [ ] Write integration tests for AJAX endpoints
- [ ] Write functional tests for complete workflows
- [ ] Test drag & drop functionality across browsers

### Documentation
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new development commands
- [ ] Document new API endpoints
- [ ] Create user documentation for the feature

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features

### Advanced UI Features
- [ ] Enhanced drag & drop with visual feedback
- [ ] Bulk operations support (select multiple items)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- [ ] Advanced tree operations (expand/collapse all)

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Lazy loading for large navigation trees
- [ ] Pagination or virtualization for very large trees
- [ ] Caching strategies for tree data
- [ ] Optimize database queries for tree operations

### Enhanced User Experience
- [ ] Better loading states and animations
- [ ] Improved error messages and validation
- [ ] Contextual help and tooltips
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Phase 3: Future Enhancements

### Extensibility
- [ ] Plugin architecture for custom item types
- [ ] Hooks/events system for extending functionality
- [ ] API versioning for future compatibility

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Localization support for item labels
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Navigation templates and presets
- [ ] Import/export functionality

### Enterprise Features
- [ ] Workflow management for navigation changes
- [ ] Approval processes for modifications
- [ ] Audit logging for all operations
- [ ] Advanced permissions and role management

## Current Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Core Functionality  
**Started**: 2025-01-11  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-11

### Recent Progress
- ✅ **Requirements Documented**: Created comprehensive requirements and technical specification documents
- ✅ **Item Resource Setup**: Added Item entity as Sylius resource with full admin CRUD integration
- ✅ **Admin Routes**: Generated standard routes at `/admin/navigation/items/*` for item management
- ✅ **Grid Configuration**: Implemented proper grid display showing item label, enabled status
- ✅ **Translation Support**: Added UI translation keys for item management interface

### Next Steps
- **Phase 1 Implementation**: Begin creating the manual tree builder interface
- **Build Controller**: Create controller for `/admin/navigations/{id}/build` route
- **API Endpoints**: Implement AJAX endpoints for tree operations
- **Frontend Components**: Build drag & drop tree interface
